my code sucks I come back to this project every so often
Simple Password Maker, to try different combinations instead of picking each single type of password. 
To get it started, just follow the directions, insert 3 interests (or 1 and press enter when it asks you again)
If you have a different directory, type 'change' when it asks you if you use linux or windows
If you don't know what a directory is, I suggest you learn more.
If you stumbled upon me and would like to support this project. Here's my bitcoin address: 1CBjBTSHE6xD177N2W4Z6BmpewXgDhBXTN
Happy Hacking! (Also if you somehow successfully use this program for illegal use, I am in no way, shape, or form responsible for what happens to you)
