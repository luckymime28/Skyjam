my code sucks, I come back to this project every now and then, I'm imporving though!
Simple Password Maker, to create a list of passwords for Bruteforcing!
To get it started, just follow the directions, insert up to 3 interests (To skip, just hit Enter)
If you have a different directory, type 'change' when it asks you if you use linux or windows.
If you don't know what a directory is, I suggest you learn more about computers in general.
If you stumbled upon me and would like to support this project, Donations are always Welcome!
